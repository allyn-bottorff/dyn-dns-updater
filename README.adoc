CAUTION: The `disable_unifi_tls_validation` option disables all TLS validation
for the calls to the UniFI controller. It exists because UniFi by default uses
a self-signed certificate. A better option is to supply a valid certificate to
the UniFi controller and not disable TLS. This option does not disable TLS
validation for calls to CloudFlare.
